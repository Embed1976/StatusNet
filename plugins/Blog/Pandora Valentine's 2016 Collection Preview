These two campaign images give a nice overview of an themes and colours when using the classic Valentine?ˉs release (click to enlarge them). Crucial factors phrase for this collection is Petals of Love, and there are a number of new designs that focus on flowers with heart-shaped petals (capable see the <a href="http://www.jewelrypandoraonline.uk.com/">pandora charms</a> and clip in the second campaign image).One from classic most exciting new offerings is a new version through the classic charm bracelet you are able to pav¨| heart clasp, which effectively combines last year?ˉs plain silver heart clasp bracelet along utilizing the Always in my Heart Mother?ˉs Day bangle.



The <a href="http://www.jewelrypandoraonline.uk.com/">pandora uk</a> pictured here are invariably romance or heart-themed; I had fun making this collage, as pinks do look rather lovely and rich may paired while using two-tone. There are a few more designs based close to our AW15 Radiant Hearts set, and of these I rather like the Hearts of Gold openwork design; the pattern is very pretty! The Love is Forever is this collection?ˉs special charm in North America, and i intend to retail for $70 USD.



I now have a picture of one final <a href="http://www.jewelrypandoraonline.uk.com/">pandora charms uk</a> for your personal Valentine?ˉs 2016 collection: a plain silver heart design, entitled Filled with Romance. It has some pretty intricate openwork detailing, although it?ˉs hard to make your patterning exactly in the stock image.In the US and Canada, the Ribbon of Love will initially be available exclusively as part ?n the Filled with Love bracelet gift set, this includes the plain silver heart-clasp bracelet (590719) from last year and Autumn 2015 Feathered clips (pictured below). This will retail for $185 USD and that we will come utilizing white leatherette wristlet.



Up next, we have earrings plus necklace to match the Petals of Love charm and clip ¨C the necklace is simply presented on a 90cm chain. In the US & Canada, these two pieces will probably be sold simply because the Petals of Love gift set, which will retail for $150 USD and be presented in a heart-shaped gift box. Again, the individual items will not be sold on their own until the 15th of February.I now have a stock image for another new necklace! Is usually a two-tone heart design, entitled United in Love.Finally, I have pictures of three new rings for those Valentine?ˉs 2016 collection. The Linked Love ring is actually plain silver, although the beaded effect makes it look a little like pav¨|.



Which happens to be a pretty typical <a href="http://www.jewelrypandoraonline.uk.com/">pandora charms sale</a> Valentine?ˉs release, with hearts and pav¨| galore. It would currently fun to see them try something different ¨C some reds or burgundies might are usually rather nice ¨C but I can understand why they are not going to change the formula if it has worked well in previous years. Again, this may not be quite all around the new jewellery so I will update the post or prepare a new one if any other pictures are leaked. Using the jewellery pictured here, I love the double hearts pink murano, and I like the pav¨| heart clasp bracelet and Ribbon of Love charms. I don?ˉt want to make another dedicated pink bracelet, however, so I will probably think of another colour or theme that I could pair the murano with.
